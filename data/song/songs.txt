I feel like I've known you for ages
I feel like with you I'm going places
The same song on repeat
"You can call me anything you want"
It's fine by me
Number two out of three
He says that it's his favorite
And I can't disagree

The same song on repeat
"You can call me anything you want"
It's fine by me
Number two out of three
He says that it's his favorite
And I can't disagree

The same song on repeat
"You can call me anything you want"
It's fine by me
Number two out of three
He says that it's his favorite
And I can't disagree

The same song on repeat
"You can call me anything you want"
It's fine by me
Number two out of three
He says that it's his favorite
And I can't disagree
